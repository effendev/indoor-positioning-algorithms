# Indoor Positioning Algorithms

## Description
In this repository, you can python code implementation of trilateration and min-max methods for calculating positions in an indoor setting using Wi-Fi RSSI data. There are two folders in this repo. These are the description of each one of them:
- algorithms: Repo for trilateration and min-max algorithm implementations.
- path-loss: Repo containing a path loss model simulation and a Path Loss calculator build using a very simple python OOP. 

## How to Run the Code
To run the codes, use this steps:
- Install `ipython3` on your computer. 
- Install the required python modules such as `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pylab`, and `Pillow`.
- On command prompt (windows) or on terminal (linux), type `ipython3` and enter. 
- On `ipyhton3` console, write `%run python-file-name.py` and enter to run the code.
- Enjoy.
